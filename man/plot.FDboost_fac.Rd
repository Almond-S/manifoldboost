\title{Prediction and plotting for factorized FDboost model components}
\usage{
\method{predict}{FDboost_fac}(object, newdata = NULL, which = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object, x}{a model-factor given as a \code{FDboost_fac} object}

\item{newdata}{optionally, a data frame or list
in which to look for variables with which to predict.
See ?predict.mboost.}

\item{which}{a subset of base-learner components to take into
account for computing predictions or coefficients. Different
components are never aggregated to a joint prediction, but always
returned as a matrix or list. Select the i-th component
by name in the format 'bl(x, ...)\link{i}' or all components of a base-learner
by dropping the index or all base-learners of a variable by using
the variable name.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{predict.FDboost()} or \code{predict.mboost()}.}
